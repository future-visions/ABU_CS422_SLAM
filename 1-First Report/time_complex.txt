A fundamental advantage of FastSLAM over EKF based approaches to the SLAM problem is that the EKF suffers from a O(K2) complexity where K being the number of landmarks. In contrast, FastSLAM has an O(M log K) complexity with M = const denoting the number of particles.

____________

Computational complexity of each EKF update step is O (n2) and the total cost known to be O (n3).
