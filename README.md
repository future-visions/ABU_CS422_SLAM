# ABU_CS422_SLAM

This project is a hands-on comparison oriented SLAM project. For the sake of the performances of algorithms and their properness in different scenarios, three main algorithms are chosen for this comparison project. In order, Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filter. At the end of the comparisons, we added our results in "Final Report".
